# Dusk

Dusk is a chatting application based on a wildly popular chat for gamers. I am developing this for learning purposes only. Design is heavy inspired by another chatting application.

## Setting Up

1. `git clone git@github.com:Corned/dusk.git`
2. Run `npm install` in both `./` and `./react-ui`
3. Create `.env` file in `./` and define `PRODUCTION_DATABASE_URL` and `MY_SPECIAL_SECRET`
4. Run `npm run dev` in `./`. This will start both the server and the client.
